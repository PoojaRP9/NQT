**Problem Statement 2:**
James loves numbers and wants to determine if a given number is prime or not. Assist him by verifying whether a number is prime or not.

**Example 2:**
James wants to check if the number 17 is prime. Since 17 has only two divisors, 1 and 17, it is prime.

**Input 2:**
A single integer representing the number to be checked for primality, e.g., 17.

**Constraints 2:**
- The input number will be an integer in the range [1, 10^9].

**Expected Output 2:**
Whether the input number is prime or not.
